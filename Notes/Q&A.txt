    - kebab-case (All Lowercase, separated by dash '-')
    - snake_case (All Lowercase, separated by underscore '_')
• How to add some code into the middle of a print string? (Ex. print("Hello World."))
    - Insert a backslash followed by a set of parentheses including the calculation. Ex '\(5+3)'
• What is it called when you add a calculation into the middle of a string?
    - String Interpolation (Ex. print("TEXT \(2+2) TEXT"))
• What is an Array?
    - An ordered sequence of items.
• How do you define a constant?
    - With the 'let' keyword. (Ex. let x = 10)
• How do you define a variable?
    - With the 'var' keyword. (Ex. var x = 10)
• What is the difference between a constant and a variable?
    - They have different keywords defining them, let v. var. 
• What is the difference between a Double & Float?
    - A Double is double the accuracy of a Float.
• How many positions does a Float have?
    - 8 positions, or 32 bits. (Ex. print(Float.pi) // 3.1415925, print(Float.pi * 1000) // 3141.5925)
• How many positions does a Double have?
    - 16 positions, or 64 bits. (Ex. print(Double.pi) // 3.141592653589793, print(Double.pi * 1000) // 3141.592653589793)
• How many data types are there in Swift?
    - 7 (Int, Float, Double, Array, Bool, String, Dictionary)
• What is a closed ranged operator?
    - '...' Includes the lower and upper values.  Used when randomizing numbers in a specific range,
• Can you have a partially open range operator?
    - Yes. '..<' Include lower bound and everything less than upper bound.
• What is the difference between Safe Area and Superview?
    - Superview is the area at the top/bottom of the phone where default Apple OS gestures and stats appear.
      Adding UI elements to these areas is frowned upon.  Hence the Safe Area auto sizes things to stay out of that area.
• Alignment v Pinning
    - Alignment Constraints force a UI object to a horizontal/vertical rule.
    - Pinning Constraints force UI objects to be a specific # of pixels from each edge of the display.
    - Align to the Center & Pin to the bottom.
• Name 3 different ways to create UI Container Views for objects to sit in.
    1. Plus button, Search "uiview", Click & Drag "View" object to Builder
    2. Select UI Objects -> Select 'Editor' menu -> Select 'Embed In' -> Select 'View'
    3. Select UI Objects -> Click icon in lower right with an arrow in a box -> Select 'View'
• What views make up the right Inspector Sidebar?
    1. File
    2. History
    3. Quick Help

• What is AVFoundation?
    - AVFoundation standing for Audio Visual Foundation is a library that you can import in swift to incorporate AV actions.
• When retrieving data from a Dictionary, what Data Type is the value?
    - Optional
• What is the difference between a function & method?
    - Generically the same thing, but a method is a function defined within a structure; aka only that structure can call it.
• What is the purpose of an initializer? (init(){})
    - To reuse a base structure to create a brand new instance of an object with its own unique values.
• What is a Design Pattern?
    - A proven solution to a common problem.... (Feel like this is a terrible explanation... xD)
• Explain the MVC Design Pattern.
    - Model: Data & Logic -> Sends data to Controller
    - View: User Interface -> Sends input events to Controller
    - Controller: Mediator -> Modifies View & Makes Requests to Models
• What specifically should the Controller be responsible for within the MVC design pattern?
    - Telling the other components what to do.
    - Respond to changes in other components.
    - Handle what to do with user actions from the view.
    - Tell the view what to display.
    - Fetch the relevant data from the model.
    - Tell the model to update itself.
    - Responsible for delegating tasks to the models & sending updated data to the UI.
• How do you unwrap an optional?
    - By adding an exclamation mark at the end of the statement. (Ex. let answer = sender.currentTitle!)
• What 4 things are required when writing a function with an output?
    1. Return Arrow '->'
    2. Return Type
    3. Return Keyword
    4. Return Value 
• What does immutable mean?
    - Can't be changed.  Created with the 'let' keyword.
• How do you allow a struct to change the value of an internal immutable field?
    - Adding the keyword 'mutating' before the function definition inside of the struct. (Ex. mutating func change(){})
• What is a SuperClass?
    - A parent class, generically having rudimentary fields & functions.
    - Inherited by Sub-Classes, and then overrides original definition or is built out with additional fields & functions.
    - Common Ex. SuperClass=Shape. Sub-Classes=Circle, Square, Triangle...
• In Swift, how do you specify a classes SuperClass?
    - In class definition. (Ex. class Square: Shape {...} )
• Is it possible to call a SuperClass method from a SubClass method?
    - Yes.  Requires the keyword 'super'. (Ex. super.method())
• What is the most basic object in Swift?
    - NSObject. NS standing for Next Step (NeXTSTEP) which was the company that Steve Jobs started when he got booted from Apple.
• What is the inheritance chain for a simple UIButton?
    - UIButton -> UIControl -> UIView -> UIResponder -> NSObject
• Differences between Classes & Structs?
    - Structs
        1. Inheritance = FALSE (Can't inherit from a Super class.)
        2. Init Method = Not Required.
        3. Immutable = TRUE
            - A 'mutating' func makes property changes by destroying the original Struct & creating a new one with updated values.
        4. Passed by = VALUE
            - You get one & I get one!
            - Copying a Struct creates an entirely new object. 
            - We go from 1 object to 2 objects.
    - Classes
        1. Inheritance = TRUE (Can inherit from a Super class.)
        2. Init Method = Required
        3. Passed by = REFERENCE
            - Everyone has to share a single object. ):
            - Copying a Class Object simply creates a new pointer to an existing object.
• What does Apple advise when creating new object templates? Structs or Classes?
    - Structs, good when you need a basic blueprint for creating objects.
• When should you create Classes instead of Structs?
    1. You need inheritance.
    2. You need to work with old Objective-C Code
• What framework is required when creating Controller classes that interact with the UI?
    - UIKit (import UIKit)
• When creating new views, what does a new View Controller ALWAYS have?
    - A View! (Which is what we use to connect the swift controller to the new view.)
• What keyword is required for Down Casting?
    - as! (Ex. let destinationVC = segue.destination as! MyViewController)
• What is a segue?
    - A relationship between views.
• When was SF Symbols added?
    - iOS 13. Set of 1,500 symbols for devs to use in their apps. SF = San Francisco.
• How do you setup your own Light/Dark Mode colors?
    - Add new Color Set to project Assets, and then change 'Appearances' to 'Any, Dark'
• How do you prevent pixelate when zooming images?
    - Using Vector Images (Udemy has pdf files for this.)
    - Also need to change Resizing to 'Preserve Vector Data' & change Scales to 'Single Scale'
• What is required when adding Light/Dark mode assets?
    - Appearance field in Inspector sidebar needs to be updated to 'Any, Dark' or 'Any, Light, Dark'.
• How to tap into device keyboard? (Ex. Capturing Enter/Return)
    - Using UITextFieldDelegate.
• Structures can't inherit like classes, but can they adopt Protocols?
    - Yes, Structs & Classes can both adopt Protocols.
• What is a Protocol?
    - A Protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or functionality.
• Can Protocols define implementation?
    - No, but protocol extensions can; however, generally adopting classes define implementations.
• What is an API?
    - An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers 
    can use to create software o interact with an external system.
    - It provides developers with standard commands for performing common operations so they do not have to write the code from scratch.
    - Essentially, it is a contract between the developer and the API provider.
• When creating a task, what method must you call to initiate the task & why?
    - The 'resume()' method must be called to start the task because newly created tasks begin in a suspended state.
• What are the 4 steps to setting up networking in Swift? (Aka API Request.)
    1. Create URL String
    2. Create URLSession
    3. Create Task for URLSession
    4. Initiate Task (Go Get that data!)
• What are Closures?
    - Closures are anonymous functions. 
    - Could also consider functions as named Closures.
    - Essentially, they are packages of functionality that can be passed around freely.
• How do you convert a function into a Closure?
    1. Remove 'func funcName' 
    2. Move left brace '{' from end of line to beginning of line.
    3. Add keyword 'in' where left bracket '{' was.
    Ex.
        func sum(n1:Int, n2:Int)->Int{return n1+n2}
        {(n1:Int, n2:Int)->Int in return n1+n2}
• What does a Model class require if it is going to be used as a JSON object representation?
    - Requires 'Decodable' keyword in definition.
• What are TypeAlias'?
    - Protocols that combine more than one Protocol. Ex. 'Codable' combines 'Decodable' & 'Encodable'.
• Why would you extend a protocol?
    - To define default behavior for required protocol methods
• What is the default segue when connecting view controllers?
    - Modal Transition - Second view slides up from bottom partially covering initial view. Like a pop-up.
• What happens when you embed the Main VC in Navigation Controller?
    - Every subsequent view automatically gets navigation buttons added to the top of the view.
• Why would you want to setup different types of Segues between views?
    - Some views might be public while others require some form of authentication or verification beforehand.
• What does Upcasting require?
    - Keyword 'as' & must inherit from the SuperClass.
• Name the 5 lifecycle methods of a View.
    1. viewDidLoad()
    2. viewWillAppear()
    3. viewDidAppear()
    4. viewWillDissapear()
    5. viewDidDissapear()
• What is the lifecycle of an app?
    1. 
What is User Defaults & what is it most commonly used for?
    - Device Storage/Database most commonly used for storing User Preferences
        Ex. 
            let defaults = UserDefaults.standard            // Get User Defaults
            defaults.set(0.24, forKey: "Volume")            // Set User Preference
            let volume = defaults.float(forKey: "Volume")   // Retrieve Volume from User Defaults

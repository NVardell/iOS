# Xcode - semi-personal settings

# Apple Shared data that Apple put in the wrong folder
# c.f. http://stackoverflow.com/a/19260712/153422
#     FROM ANSWER: Apple says "don't ignore it"
#     FROM COMMENTS: Apple is wrong; Apple code is too buggy to trust; there are no known negative side-effects to ignoring Apple's unofficial advice and instead doing the thing that actively fixes bugs in Xcode
# Up to you, but ... current advice: ignore it.

# This is complicated...
#   SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
#   Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are saved in this file.
#   99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.
#       NB: Also, whitelist the default ones, some projects need to use these
